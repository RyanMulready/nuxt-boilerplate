# Nuxt 3 Boilerplate

This is my personal boilerplate for developing with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/). It includes a setup for TypeScript, linting, testing, and best practices to streamline development.

## Features

- **Nuxt 3** with TypeScript
- **ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier** for code quality
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **Pinia** for state management
- **i18n support** with `@nuxtjs/i18n`
- **PrimeVue and PrimeFlex** for UI components and utility classes
- **Nuxt Image & Fonts** for optimized asset handling

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

Start the Nuxt development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Linting & Formatting

Check for linting errors:

```sh
npm run lint
```

Run Prettier to format the codebase:

```sh
npm run prettier
```

## Type Checking

Ensure TypeScript correctness:

```sh
npm run type:check
```

## Testing

Run unit tests using Vitest:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Husky & Git Hooks

After installing dependencies, Husky is automatically set up to enforce commit message conventions and linting.
